# ðŸ“˜ DNA Interactive (Correlation Tool)

This interactive visually demonstrates the **structure of DNA** and highlights how the four nitrogenous bases â€” **Adenine (A)**, **Thymine (T)**, **Cytosine (C)**, and **Guanine (G)** â€” pair with each other. Users can observe the double helix structure and see color-coded base pairs:  
- **Adenine (A)** pairs with **Thymine (T)**  
- **Cytosine (C)** pairs with **Guanine (G)**
